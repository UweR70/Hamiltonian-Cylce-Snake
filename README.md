# Hamiltonian-Cylce-Snake

# Story:
This is all about the game Snake https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)<br/>
and Hamilitonian Cycles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path)<br/>
as seen here<br/>

.. can be made much smoozer which will reseult in much better path shortcuts.<br/>
<br/>
So the seed were set ... and I started this project.<br/>
